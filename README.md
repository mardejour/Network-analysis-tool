# Network-analysis-tool
A python package that takes a csv, turns it into node-edge data for use in creating network visualizations of Twitter interactions. Does not use external libraries. The input csv can be quite large, so the module is able to handle large amounts of text data in a reasonable time frame. The module will need to provide an API that is usable in any other Python app in Python 3.6 or higher. The specification of the input csv is negotiable. To avoid portability issues, the module does not use outside libraries. The module must provide documentation both within the code and outside of it as to its proper use. This module is publicly available for download, forking, and use. This module was created to help all Digital Humanities and/or Social Media researchers to cut time off the process of conducting Twitter-based social research. The output can be used to generate network analyses in a myriad of visualization tools.
